  <abstract>The Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR) contains citizen science data from Landslide Reporter put into the database as Landslide Reporter Catalog (event_import_source = ‘LRC’) and data from NASA’s Global Landslide Catalog (event_import_source = ‘GLC’) compiled since 2007. For more information about the fields, see the How-to Guide documentation under the “Get Started” tab at https://landslides.nasa.gov and the publications below. 
Background
The Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) was developed with the goal of identifying rainfall-triggered landslide events around the world, regardless of size, impacts or location. The GLC considers all types of mass movements triggered by rainfall and some triggered by other events, that have been reported in the media, disaster databases, scientific reports, or other sources. The GLC has been compiled since 2007 at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.
The Cooperative Open Online Landslide Repository (COOLR) is a worldwide database of landslide events. It currently includes NASA’s Global Landslide Catalog (GLC) and other landslide reports contributed by citizen scientists. In the future, other landslide inventories will be added to COOLR.
Methods
We use 'landslide' as a general term to represent all event types. The catalog differentiates between landslide types when the information is available in the landslide_category field. COOLR follows a similar methodology to the GLC, and its fields and other information are documented in the publications below. Landslide events in the GLC were obtained from online news media, links to reported landslides in newspapers, hazard databases, scientific reports, blog entries, and personal communication and other sources. Online news articles serve as the primary sources of information for the landslide catalog and are found using Google Alerts (www.google.com/alerts) and other search engine options. Citizen science points submitted to COOLR through Landslide Reporter are checked for accuracy compared to the source material, accuracy of location and landslide identification, and the quality of the description provided. The source of the information in all COOLR points and polygons are described in the individual objects, which can be found in the source_name and source_link columns.
